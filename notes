dementiabank
=

Put into internal form
Wapiti
Match speech to text
Phonemes/words over time


Binary classification,
Alzheimers vs dementia (vascular)
MCI

invariant across speakers, fhvae, pca, find the meaningful information, kmeans, interpretable clustering
explaining the factors, decomposing distance into explainable factors
aspects that are common to people with dementia

Experiments / SPHERE house:

    Add background noises
    Add distractors
    More complex words

    Alexa/FireStick? Can send audio to sphere? Ideal, otherwise copy sphere data out
    What to buy: Tablet / Alexa / Microphone (Directional)Â 

    PESQ, PEAQ
    Patients: repeat sentences (control sentence), amount of time before speaking (thinking time), phonemes
    Cognitive load, reading vs. thinking vs. remembering
    TV: splitter to get audio/video

Venues:

    ECML, MLSP, NIPS, Interspeech, ICASSP, AISTATS, AAAI, KDD

Current Projects / ideas:
    speech clustering based on selectable criteria (via VAE/ PCA, or otherwise)
    splitting audio into important pieces, summarisation, option selection, segmentation
    work on dementiabank data: classification with interpretability
    novelty detection, at hierarchical level.
    multiple instance learning over time - structure in dementia speech

    mocha test

    screening test - find sub areas - objective evidence of difficulties
    frontotemporal dementia - behavioural, disinhibited,
      - speech output area - nonfluent primary progressive aphasia
      - semantic variant - fluent but knowledge is affected - cannot distinguish between things

    within certain period - improvement is noticed
